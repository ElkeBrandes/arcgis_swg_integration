# arcgis_swg_integration
ArcGIS workflow to identify subfield areas that should be converted to switchgrass, based on yield, patch size, and distance of small patches to larger patches.

This repo includes python scripts that run processes in ArcGIS.

I am starting the repo with the files that I have worked on to date.
